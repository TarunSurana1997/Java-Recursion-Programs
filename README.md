This repository contains solutions to common programming problems implemented using **recursion** in a simple and easy-to-understand manner.

## List of Programs

1. **Print "Hello my dear" N times using Recursion**  
   Prints the phrase `"Hello my dear"` exactly N times recursively.

2. **Print Numbers from N to 1**  
   Prints numbers starting from N down to 1 using recursion.

3. **Print Numbers from 1 to N**  
   Prints numbers starting from 1 up to N using recursion.

4. **Find the Factorial of a Number**  
   Calculates the factorial of a given number recursively.

5. **Find the nth Fibonacci Number**  
   Computes the nth number in the Fibonacci sequence recursively.

6. **Sum of First N Natural Numbers**  
   Calculates the sum of the first N natural numbers using recursion.

7. **Find the Sum of Digits of a Number**  
   Recursively sums all the digits of a given number.

8. **Count the Number of Digits of a Number**  
   Counts how many digits a number has using recursion.

9. **Print Even Numbers from 2 to N**  
   Prints all even numbers from 2 up to N recursively.

10. **Print a Number in Reverse**  
    Prints the digits of a number in reverse order using recursion.

11. **Calculate Product of First N Natural Numbers**  
    Calculates the product (factorial-like) of the first N natural numbers recursively.

12. **Print Sum of an Array Using Recursion**  
    Recursively calculates the sum of all elements in an array.

13. **Print All Elements of an Array Using Recursion**  
    Prints each element of an array recursively.

14. **Calculate Sum of Squares of First N Numbers**  
    Calculates the sum of squares of numbers from 1 to N recursively.

15. **Check if a Number is Palindrome**  
    Checks whether a given number reads the same backward as forward using recursion.
